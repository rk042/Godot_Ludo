# Godot Ludo

Welcome, game developers! You are in the right place to start learning the Godot Engine by working on a real-world game—Ludo.

This repository contains a Godot Engine project built with GDScript. I started this open-source project to learn Godot and GDScript while also providing a practical project for beginners who want to explore the engine through hands-on experience.

If you are eager to contribute in any way—whether through art, code, sound, VFX, or animation—your help is most welcome! If you would like to connect with me before submitting a pull request, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn (you can find the link in my GitHub profile).

## Screenshots
Here are the initial screenshots of the game. This is the early version, and the visuals will be updated once we have contributors for art.

## Contribution Guidelines
At present, there are no strict contribution rules. As the project progresses, I will define guidelines accordingly. However, for those interested in contributing:

1. The master branch contains the latest merged code and serves as the complete game source.
2. All development work should be done in feature/development branches.
3. Pull requests should be submitted to the feature/development branch, following this structure: feature/*.

## Project Structure
Please try to follow the project structure I have established. However, you may adjust it as needed. If you are contributing as a game programmer, you must adhere to this structure.
